# 🚀 Deployment Overview

DUMB can be deployed across a variety of platforms and environments. Whether you're using **Docker**, **Portainer**, **Unraid**, **WSL2**, or other systems like **TrueNAS**, **Synology**, or **QNAP**, this section will guide you through the available options to get DUMB up and running.

All deployment methods provide access to the same integrated services and configurations, with slight differences in how the container is started and managed.

## 🔐 Additional Notes

- All methods rely on a valid and accessible `dumb_config.json` file for configuring services.
- It is strongly recommended to bind-mount a local `config` directory to persist user data.

Example:
```yaml
dumb:
  image: iampuid0/dumb:latest
  volumes:
    - ./config:/config
```

For more about configuring services, see the [Configuration](../features/configuration.md) page.
