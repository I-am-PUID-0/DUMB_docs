## ‍ Development Contributions

Want to help develop new features, fix bugs, or improve performance?

### Recommended Setup
The easiest way to contribute code is through the **DUMB Dev Container**, which includes all the required tools:

- Based on: `iampuid0/dumb:latest`
- Python with Black autoformatter
- Port forwarding for common services
- Preconfigured workspace mounts

You can find the [devcontainer setup file](https://github.com/I-am-PUID-0/DUMB/tree/master/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) in the repo.

### How to Get Started

1. Fork the [DUMB repository](https://github.com/I-am-PUID-0/DUMB)
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Open in **VS Code** using **Dev Containers**
4. Make your changes, format with `black`, and submit a pull request

!!! note "If you’re not using VS Code or Dev Containers, you can also run the project via Docker with the same mounts shown in the `devcontainer.json`."
