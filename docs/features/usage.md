# Usage

## 🚀 Running DUMB
DUMB automatically starts the services defined in `dumb_config.json` in the proper order. Each service can also be managed independently using the [DUMB Frontend](../services/dumb-frontend.md/) or by directly modifying the configuration.
!!! important "Important: Configure API Key Before Startup"
    DUMB is preset to start all services on the first startup.  
    As such, please ensure `ZURG_INSTANCES_REALDEBRID_API_KEY` is configured with your RealDebrid API Key in the compose **before starting the container**.


### 🔄 Automatic Service Start
All services with `"enabled": true` in the config will be started on container launch. These typically include:

- DUMB API
- DUMB Frontend
- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin 4
- rclone
- Riven Backend & Frontend
- Zilean
- Zurg

If a service fails to start, check its log file in the `/log` directory (or wherever `log_dir` is set).

## 🔃 Managing Updates

### 🛠️ Manual Updates
Each service can be updated by modifying the configuration file or using the [DUMB Frontend](../services/dumb-frontend.md). 

Updates include:

- Branch switching
- Version pinning
- Auto-update toggling

### ⚙️ Auto-Update
Some services support automatic updates. 

Enable by setting:
```json
"auto_update": true,
"auto_update_interval": 24
```
!!! note "`auto_update_interval` is measured in hours."

Services supporting auto-updates:

- DUMB Frontend
- Riven Backend
- Riven Frontend
- Zilean
- Zurg

---

## ⚡ Shutdown Handling
DUMB handles graceful shutdown of all services. 

This includes:

- Stopping running processes
- Unmounting rclone mounts
- Syncing configuration states

To allow time for clean shutdowns, use:
```yaml
docker-compose:
  stop_grace_period: 60s
```

---

## 📌 Tips
- Always monitor `/log/*.log` files for troubleshooting or monitor the logs from the **DUMB Frontend**.
- Ensure PostgreSQL is running before launching services that depend on it.
- If using Real-Debrid, ensure `api_key` is provided in rclone or Zurg instances.
- Logs can be colored if `color_log` is enabled in the config.
