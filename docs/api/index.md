# ‚öôÔ∏è DMB API

DMB includes a built-in REST API and WebSocket server to allow programmatic control of services, logging, and system state.

The API is enabled and configured using the `dmb_config.json` under the `dmb.api_service` section. For example:

```json
"api_service": {
  "enabled": true,
  "process_name": "DMB API",
  "log_level": "INFO",
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 8000
}
```

## ‚ú® Features
- Health checks
- Process management (start, stop, restart services)
- Real-time log streaming via WebSocket
- Configuration viewing and updates (in-memory and persistent)
- Environment state inspection

## üóÇÔ∏è Directory Structure
The DMB API is split into the following modules:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `api_service.py` | Initializes and launches the FastAPI app |
| `api_state.py` | Tracks and updates service runtime state |
| `connection_manager.py` | Manages WebSocket client connections |
| `config.py` | Endpoints for working with `dmb_config.json` and service configs |
| `health.py` | Health check endpoint for validating API status |
| `logs.py` | REST endpoint for reading historical logs |
| `websocket_logs.py` | WebSocket server for streaming real-time logs to frontend |
| `process.py` | Service control for backend processes (start, stop, restart) |

## üß≠ API Documentation

DMB provides built-in API documentation through two convenient endpoints:

- **FastAPI Swagger UI**  
  Accessible at:  
  `http://<host>:<port>/docs`  
  This interface allows for interactive testing and exploring of all available REST endpoints.

- **Scalar (ReDoc-style) Docs**  
  Accessible at:  
  `http://<host>:<port>/scalar`  
  A clean, read-only view of the full OpenAPI schema for the DMB API.

These are helpful for development, debugging, and integrating external systems with DMB.
