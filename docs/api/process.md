The `core_services` field can be a single object or an array. The `name` can be the config key (e.g., `riven_backend`) or a display name (e.g., `Riven`).

#### 🔧 Request Body Examples:

**Riven**

```json
{
  "core_services": {
    "name": "riven_backend",
    "debrid_service": "RealDebrid",
    "debrid_key": "abc123",
    "service_options": {}
  },
  "optional_services": ["zilean", "pgadmin", "riven_frontend"]
}
```

**Decypharr**

```json
{
  "core_services": {
    "name": "decypharr",
    "debrid_service": "RealDebrid",
    "debrid_key": "abc123",
    "service_options": {
      "decypharr": { "use_embedded_rclone": true }
    }
  },
  "optional_services": []
}
```

**CLI Debrid**

```json
{
  "core_services": {
    "name": "cli_debrid",
    "debrid_service": "RealDebrid",
    "debrid_key": "abc123",
    "service_options": {
      "phalanx_db": { "enabled": true }
    }
  },
  "optional_services": ["zilean"]
}
```

**Plex Debrid**

```json
{
  "core_services": {

    "service_options": {
      "rclone": { "log_level": "DEBUG" },
      "zurg": { "port": 9194 }
    }
  },
  "optional_services": []
}
```

#### ✅ Example Response:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {"service": "riven_backend", "status": "started"},
    {"service": "decypharr", "status": "started"}
  ],
  "errors": []
}
```

#### ℹ️ Notes:

* Dependencies like Zurg or rclone are created using templates and attached to the calling core service.
* Optional services such as `pgadmin` or `zilean` are started only if included.
* `debrid_key` is injected into Zurg or Decypharr as needed.
* `service_options` can override config values such as `log_level`, `port`, or `enabled`.
* Any startup errors appear in the `errors` list.

---

### `GET /process/core-services`

Returns the available core services, their dependencies, and default service options (used by onboarding).

---

### `GET /process/optional-services`

Returns optional services. You can pass `core_service` and `optional_services` query params to tailor the list.

---

## 🧐 Notes

* All process names are matched against the entries defined in `dumb_config.json`.
* Most process commands are defined as arrays and are managed with subprocess handling inside Python.
