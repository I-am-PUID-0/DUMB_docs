## About DUMB (Debrid Unlimited Media Bridge)

**Debrid Unlimited Media Bridge (DUMB)** is an all-in-one, containerized platform for managing and automating media workflows using premium debrid services like Real-Debrid. Whether you're looking to automate downloads, organize libraries, mount remote content, or just reduce manual steps — DUMB aims to unify it all into a seamless experience.

---

## Mission

DUMB was created with a single goal:

**Bridge the gap between cloud-based debrid services and traditional media server ecosystems like Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby — with maximum automation and minimal configuration.**

By directly integrating the **media server itself** (e.g. Plex) within the DUMB container, the platform overcomes long-standing issues like broken bind mount propagation, sync delays, and external scan conflicts common in multi-container setups.

---

## What Makes DUMB Unique?

Unlike other solutions that focus on one piece of the puzzle, **DUMB integrates every step** of the media pipeline:

*  *Embedded Media Servers* — Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby run inside the same container, ensuring seamless access to mounted content and full internal control
*  *Service Coordination* — via the internal DUMB API and real-time config management
*  *Automated Acquisition* — with core services for discovery and Zurg and/or rclone for debrid content fetching
*  *Cloud Storage Mounting* — through rclone mounts direct to debrid (e.g., Real-Debrid WebDAV) or utilizing Zurg's WebDAV
*  *Library Management* — using symlinks, metadata enrichment, and optional server updates
*  *Metadata Caching* — with Zilean to reduce latency and boost scraping efficiency
*  *Visual Control* — via the DUMB Frontend for live logs, settings, and monitoring

All services are configured through a centralized file (`dumb_config.json`) and can be dynamically updated at runtime via the DUMB Frontend.
