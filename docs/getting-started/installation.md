## ‚úÖ System Requirements

- **Docker or Docker-compatible environment**
- Linux system (WSL on Windows)
- Minimum 2 vCPU, 2GB RAM, SSD recommended
- External media server such as **Plex, Jellyfin, or Emby** (optional but recommended)


!!! warning "Docker Desktop" 
    Docker Desktop **CANNOT** be used to run DUMB. 

    Docker Desktop does not support the [mount propagation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-bind-propagation) required for rclone mounts.

|`/zurg/RD`                  | Location for Zurg RealDebrid active configuration | 
|`/data:shared`              | Location for rclone mount to host                 |
|`/riven/backend/data`       | Location for Riven Backend data                   |

!!! note "/data:shared"    
    The `:shared` must be included in order to support [mount propagation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/#configure-bind-propagation) for rclone to the host
